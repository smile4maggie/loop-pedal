# Beets - An iOS Loop Pedal App
Beets is an iOS Loop Pedal app my team created during my first hackathon: UC Berkeley's CalHacks 3.0 from November 11 - 13, 2016. Although there were other parts integrated in the original project, such as an Arduino pedal and a BPM monitor, this loop-pedal file is the part of the project I coded, which includes the basic audio looping function, as well as the UI/UX. I made the graphics using Adobe Illustrator.

# Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank my team: Kevin Chien, Kelly Huang, Aaron Li, and Lawrence Chen, a group of first-year students at UC Berkeley studying EECS/CS, for pulling all-nighters with me, learning with me, and making my first hackathon memorable.
